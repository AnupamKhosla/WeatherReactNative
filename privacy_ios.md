## Information Collection and Use

The Application is designed to protect your privacy. **The Service Provider does not directly collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) from your device.**

### 1. Device and Usage Information (Automatically Collected)

The Application collects basic usage information when you download and use it. This information may include non-personally identifiable data such as:

* Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address)
* The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages
* The time spent on the Application
* The operating system you use on your mobile device

### 2. Geolocation Data (Transient Use Only)

The Application uses your device's location **transiently and locally** to provide weather data:

* **How it is Used:** The Application accesses your device’s current location (latitude and longitude) **only** for the purpose of fetching current weather information from an external, third-party weather API.
* **Data Handling:** **The geolocation data is not collected, stored, or transmitted to the Service Provider’s server.** It is processed on your device and immediately discarded after the weather information request is completed.

The Service Provider may use the non-personal usage information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information or required notices.

## Third Party Access

The Application uses external services to function:

1.  **Weather API:** The app transmits your **transient location data** directly to the chosen external weather provider API to fetch local weather information. Please refer to that provider's privacy policy for their data handling practices.
2.  **Analytics/Crash Reporting (If Applicable):** Aggregated, anonymized log data and usage data (as described above) is periodically transmitted to external services (such as crash reporters) to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.

The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:

* as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
* when they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
* with their trusted services providers who work on their behalf, do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy statement.

## Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy.
